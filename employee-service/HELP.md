# Spring Cloud Netflix Maintenance Mode

The dependencies listed below are in maintenance mode. We do not recommend adding them to new projects:

* Ribbon

The decision to move most of the Spring Cloud Netflix projects to maintenance mode was a response to Netflix not
continuing maintenance of many of the libraries that we provided support for.

Please
see [this blog entry](https://spring.io/blog/2018/12/12/spring-cloud-greenwich-rc1-available-now#spring-cloud-netflix-projects-entering-maintenance-mode)
for more information on maintenance mode and a list of suggested replacements for those libraries.
